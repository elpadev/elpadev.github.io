Often, hard times can make us stronger and more resilient. It just came to my mind how much this relates to shifting baselines.

For example, if you have always been healthy, a simple cold may feel like the end of the world.  
But if you have endured a serious illness for a long period, you can probably cope with a cold much better.  
In this sense, you are more resilient.

Or, if you once lived in a poor country and are now living just above the poverty line in a wealthy country, you may not feel as poor and might even consider yourself in a good position.

So, does this mean that simply going through hard times makes you more resilient?  
Shouldnâ€™t we also consider how you cope with those hardships?

To some degree, experiencing hard times does make you more resilient.  
Because of your past experiences, you know that it is not the end of the world.  
Things get better. This gives you hope, and hope gives you the strength to work toward improving your situation.
