We often hear that a substance can be dissolved in another fluid substance.  
For example, sugar dissolves in hot tea when stirred, just as honey dissolves in warm milk.  
But what does it actually mean if a substance can be dissolved in another?

Let’s take the example of honey and milk.  
When honey is added to milk, the milk changes color, becoming less white.

If stirred thoroughly, the milk becomes evenly colored and remains so unless it cools.  
What happens at the microscopic level when “milk particles” and “honey particles” are evenly distributed?

It means that the forces attracting “milk particles” and “honey particles” to each other are at least as strong as those between the “honey particles” themselves.  
The “honey particles” are pulled apart by the “milk particles”.
