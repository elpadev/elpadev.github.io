When trying to solve a difficult problem, it is often a good idea to start as simply as possible. The simplest version of a problem often contains the essence of the original one.

For example, let’s say we want to understand why the sky is blue. A simpler version of this problem would be: *“Why is anything blue?”*  
Interestingly, the answer to this much simpler question already contains much of the explanation for the original one.

Or take another example: calculating 123 divided by 2. That’s not necessarily straightforward (at least with my calculation skills ;-)).  
A simpler way to approach it is to break it down:  

- 100 ÷ 2 = 50  
- 20 ÷ 2 = 10  
- 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5  

So:  

\[
123 ÷ 2 = (100 ÷ 2) + (20 ÷ 2) + (3 ÷ 2)
\]

This technique of simplifying a problem reminds me of Pablo Picasso’s work *The Bull*.  
A detailed drawing of a bull is clearly a bull. But even a drawing reduced to just a few lines is still recognizably a bull.
