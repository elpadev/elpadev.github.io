The prefix sum method is efficient because it doesnâ€™t iterate through every possible subarray.

Instead, at each iteration, it asks the question: Have we seen a subarray that fulfills the condition and ends at the current index?

At each iteration, it counts the number of valid subarrays that end at the current index.
